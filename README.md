# Adventure-Works-Report
Use PowerBI to create a relational data model, add calculated columns and DAX measures from scratch, and design a report for data analysis and visualization.

### Workflow:
###### 1. Connect and shape data in PowerBI Desktop: practice pivoting/unpivoting, merging queries, defining hierarchies.
###### 2. Build [relational data model](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vanessawong26/Adventure-Works-Report/main/RelationalDataModel.png), making sure there is one-to-many cardinality between Lookup tables and Data tables.
###### 3. Calculate DAX measures and columns from scratch for data analysis and visualization.
###### 4. Generate 4-page [report](https://github.com/vanessawong26/Adventure-Works-Report/blob/main/AdventureWorks_Report.pdf) consisting of Executive Summary, Product Detail, Customer Detail, and Q&A pages.
###### 5. Link page bookmarks, add drill up/down functionality, add date and price adjustment slicers to increase ease of navigation/filtering of the report (features shown in the original PowerBI Desktop file, linked [here](https://github.com/vanessawong26/Adventure-Works-Report/blob/main/AdventureWorks_Report.pbix))


###### * Data, data model, and report were created as part of a course project by [Maven Analytics](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/).
